# Why pyramid structure
- People automatically sort and categorize information in a pyramidal group so it's easier for them if we can presort it.
- Any documents written should be deliberately structured as a pyramid
- The magical number of Seven (+-2), when the number of ideas/items is more than 7, the mind starts to organize them into categories, so that we remember the abstract levels instead of the items themselves
- Example:
  - Apple
  - Milk
  - Orange
  - Grapes
  - Eggs
  - Potatoes
  - Carrots
  - Butter
  - Sour cream
- These can be categorized into 3 categories:
  - Fruits
  - Dairy food
  - Vegetables
# Thinking from botom up
- The thinking that leads to the top down structure is actually opposite, it's bottom up
- After grouping ideas to support 1 level of abstraction up, we can build the pyramid until there is no idea left
- The ideas in a pyramid must always summerize the ideas below them
- The ideas in the same group have to be the same kind of idea. For example: apple and orange are both fruit, but apple and chair are not the same kind.
- The ideas in the same group have to be logically ordered
  - If it's formed by reasoning deductively then we order by argument order (big premise, minor premise, conclusion)
  - If it's formed by working out cause-and-effect then we order chronologically
  - If it's by commenting on an existing structure then we go with structure 
  - And if it's by categorizing then we go with the importance 

**Main Message / Recommendation**
- **Key Line (summary of logic)**
  - Argument A  
    - Evidence A1  
    - Evidence A2  
  - Argument B  
    - Evidence B1  
  - Argument C  
    - Evidence C1  
    - Evidence C2


# Substructures within the pyramid
- When start writing, we can't form the clear structure yet but there are relationships we can rely on to speed up this process
## The Vertical relationship
- Helps set up a question/answer dialogue which will keep the listener interested because it forces them to respond logically
- Each box contains an idea, it raises a question in listener's mind because we're telling them something they don't know.
- And when we tell someone something they don't know, it automatically raises a question in their mind, how? Why?
- We continue to raise and answer questions, until we reach the point when the listener no longer has any questions, then we can leave the first leg and go back to the Key Line to keep answering other arguments
- To ensure total reader attention, we need to refrain from raising any questions that you don't have the clear answer or from answering questions before raising them.
- Example
  - ❌: We assumne that the customers prefer digital banks over traditional bank, that cost reduction is key and migration to cloud is feasible. Therefore, we recommend to replace the core in 24 months and develop a new digital banking app
  - ✅: We recommend replacing the core in 24 months and develop a new digital banking app because it could reduce cost in long term, improves compliance, enable new products and capture customers interest. This conclusion rests in 3 assumption:
    - Customers prefer digital bank over traditional
    - Legacy core maintenance costs exceed 10% of our budget
    - Cloud migration is feasible
- In the first example, we're answering the question before raising them. The question here `ISN'T` the question `in the text` but the question in `reader's mind`. By stating the answer in the second text, we raise the question "How" in `reader's mind` and continue to elaborate
- Another example:
**Pigs should be kept as pet** (why?)
  **Key Line (summary of logic)**
    **They are beautiful** (how are they beautiful?)
        ***They're maverlously fat*** (how is fat beautiful?)
        - Present lovely curves to the outlooker 
        - Create modesty in the professor
        ***They're typically English*** (how is English beautiful?)
        1. Linked to the land (how are they linked to the land?)
           - Like the chalk downs
           - Like the beech tree
        2. Symbolize that power is not inconsistent with kindness
        3. So English, they deserve to be national symbol
    **Could be bred to fascinating variations** (How? And why?)
        ***In types***
        ***In size***
        ***In personalities***
        ***In functions***

## The horizontal relationship
- This is the relationship between sibling ideas, at the same level that support another idea 1 level above.
- The statement we say below not only has to answer the question above it but also answer it logically, either inductively or deductively but never both.
### Deductive grouping
- Deductive grouping presents an argument in successive steps:
  - First idea: states a general truth
  - Second idea: relates to a specific case, of our own
  - Third idea: draws a conclusion from both
- Example:
  - Exercise improves health (a general truth)
  - Walking is a form of exercise (a more specific form of exercise)
  - Therefore, walking improve health (conclusion)
- In the case of core banking system:
  - Legacy core systems are costly to maintain, and our core is not an exception.
  - This states a general truth that legacy cores are costly, and because our core is legacy (omitted), it's obviously expensive too.
### Inductive thinking
- Group a list of independent ideas to support the bigger idea
- Example:
  - The core banking system is 15 years old
  - Its end of day operations cost a downtime of 2 hours
  - It's unstable and results in customers' complaints
  - Thus we need to replace it with a newer next generation core
## The introductory flow
- The narrative should start by answering the question that is already in the reader's mind or it would exist if the reader thinks about it.
- To make the question surface naturally, follow the pattern:
  - Situation: the current state
  - Complication: what has gone wrong/not working
  - Question: show the problem that arises from the complication
  - Answer: present the main point
- This offers a few advantages:
  - You and the reader start from the same understanding of reality
  - The reader wants to know the answer before you answering it
  - Clear focus and logical flow
- Example:
  - ❌: The purpose of this document is to pull together some ideas to address some problems of the current core banking system such as:
    1. It's a legacy system that has served for 15 years
    2. Its costs exceed IT budget by 10%
    3. It usually results in downtimes that draws customers' complaints
    4. Compliance issues with regulators
  - ✅: The bank’s current core system has operated for 15 years without modernization. It now exceeds the IT budget by 10%, experiences frequent downtime, and struggles to meet new regulatory requirements — all of which affect customer satisfaction. To address these issues, we recommend replacing it with a modern, cloud-native core that delivers high availability, lower maintenance cost, and full compliance with current standards.
- In the first example, we already answer a` question that has not been raised`: let's address the problem. What is the problem? Why are we addressing it already?
- In the second example, we state the `problem` that everyone knows about (legacy core), then its `complication` (downtime, compliance...) which `raises a question` in reader's mind (ok how to address this) if they have not thought about it already, then we answer the question.
- If the reader has `already had the question` (how to address these problems) then it seems `redundant` at first, but if the reader has not thought about question, then the first few sentences should `help raise it`.

# How to build a pyramid structure
## Top-down approach
1. Draw a box on top of the pyramid, write the subject we're discussing about
2. Decide the question: visualize the reader, to whom we're dicussing with, and what question do we want to answer in his mind? State that question
3. Write down the answer if we know it
4. Identify the situation: state a fact that the reader could agree with. This is to share the same reality with the reader before raising the question. This fact becomes the `Situation`
5. Develop the `Complication`: begin the question/answer dialogue with the reader. Imagine that they nod and say "Yes I know that, so what?". This helps us raise the question in reader's mind from the `Situation`: something went wrong, disrepancies?
6. Recheck the Question and Answer: the statement of `Complication` should raise the same `question` that we decided in the step 2, if not then perhaps the `question` was wrong or our `Complication` was wrong, we have to change the `Complication` or think again
- This entire process is to make sure we know the Question we want to answer, once we have the question, everything else falls into place
- Example:
  - ❌: We have received the request to review the feasibility of processing Big Chief's Delivery ticket via disk in to our National Accounts System. We have completed our review and here is our findings:
    - Big Chief needs to follow this format...
    - Big Chief will create a program that run against their new file to extract all tickets. The output file will be in a format accepted by our NA system.
    - Upon completion, the balanced cash disk will be processed through our NA system...
- This example doesn't answer the main question: "Is it feasible?" but goes straight to "How to do it?"
- If we follow the Top-down approach, here are the steps:
    1. What is the subject: Big Chief is asking for a change
    2. What is the question: is it feasible to process the disk?
    3. What is the answer: Yes
    4. What is the situation: Big Chief asks us to process a disk instead of thousand of tickets `(move the subject to the situation, this is a fact, easy to agree with)`
    5. What is the complication: They're asking is it possible (`make sure that this statement is aligned with the question from step 2`)
    6. Move to the next question: but why would we do that?
    7. Answer to the next question with arguments: better cash flow, less work load, gives us the information we need
## Bottom-up approach
1. List out all points we want to make
2. Try to find relationships between them
3. Draw conclusion
- Example: findings at the printing company about their process that point out that they're inefficient and not competitive
  - Problems:
    - Low productivity in composing
    - Same steps for each job
    - Uncompetitive for simple jobs
    - Behind schedule
    - Lower wages
    - Shortage of people
    - High overtime
    - Below PAR
  - Solutions:
    - Simplify the process for cheap jobs
    - Increase productivity by changing methods
- Find the relationship, looks like there is some cause-and-effect relationships here:
  - Lower wages
  -> Shortage of people
  -> Behind schedule
  -> High overtime
  -> High cost
  - Same steps
  -> Below PAR 
  -> Low productivity
  => everything leads to Uncompetitive price
- Since we have all the ideas/findings and relationships, we can start to fit them into the model:
  - Situation (what are the known facts): composition costs are the most important and Uncompetitive
  - Questions: how to reduce composition costs and increase productivity
  - Complications: 
    - Shortage of good compositors, lower wages, high overtime, lower than PAR => can we hire better people, and retain our people? Yes
    - Same steps for all process, increases price, lower than PAR => can we make this more efficient? Yes
  - Key line (How do we solve this)
    - Raise the wages to hire more people and retain the compositors we have
    - Cut unnecessary steps to increase efficiency and reduce price.
- Higher wages:
  `why?`- Can hire more people
    `why?`- Get more work done efficiently
      `how?`- More experienced compositors
      `how?`- Bigger workforce to share the work
    `why?`- Retain people
      `how?`- Less work per compositor
      `how?`- No more overtime
  `why?`- Help retain people
    `how?`- People like to stay because the income is higher

- Cut unncessary steps:
  `why?`- Can reduce the amount of work
    `how?`- All redundant steps are eliminated which reduces worker's time
  `why?`- Can reduce prices for simple jobs
    `how?`- With less time spending on these steps, we can reduce unncessary costs

- Rewrite the findings:
```
After two weeks of analysis, I found that composition costs — currently accounting for 40–55% of total printing expenses — can be reduced by around 10% while improving our productivity and pricing competitiveness.
We recommend two initiatives to achieve this:
- Raise the wages of compositors to attract and retain skilled workers.
- Eliminate redundant steps in the composition process to streamline production.

1. Raise the wages of compositors
Our current wages are lower than the market average, making it difficult to hire and retain experienced compositors. This shortage has led to undercapacity, excessive overtime, and, recently, the resignation of two staff members.
By raising wages to a competitive level, we can:
- Expand the workforce: Attract skilled compositors who work more efficiently, share the workload, and improve overall quality.
- Retain existing staff: Reduce overtime and stress, leading to higher satisfaction and lower turnover.
A stable, experienced team will improve both productivity and quality, helping us meet or exceed our PAR targets.

1. Eliminate redundant steps in composition
Our current process includes repeated checks designed to ensure quality. While effective, these repetitions add unnecessary time and cost, especially for simple jobs.
By removing redundant steps where quality will not be compromised, we can:
- Increase productivity: Reduce the time required per job and improve overall throughput.
- Lower costs for simple jobs: Make our pricing more competitive in high-volume, low-margin work.
A review team is already comparing the current process with a simplified one to measure the marginal difference. Early findings indicate that these changes could reduce composition costs by approximately 10% without affecting quality.

In summary, raising wages and simplifying workflows will help us solve the capacity issue, improve productivity, and strengthen our price competitiveness.
```

# For beginners
1. Always try with `top-down` first 
2. Use the `Situation` as the starting point for thinking throught the introduction
3. Don't omit thinking through the introduction, if you know the `Question` of the `Situation`, then `ask it out loud` before moving to the `Key line` and answering the new `questions`
4. Always put `historical chronology` in the introduction, mention the time and place the situation happens because in the body, there are only logical ideas 
5. `Limit` the introduction to what the readers will `agree` is true
6. If possible, use `induction` over `deduction` to formulate arguments on the Key line level because it's less effort to comprehend, you state the conclusion and then begin to introduce supporting facts/arguments

# Fine points of instroductions
## Where to start the Situation
- If it's a memo, start with something that both you and reader already agree with
- If it's report or publication, start with a generally accepted fact
- The opening should be:
  - Grounded in a specific `time` and `place`
  - Facts that readers natually accept
  - Lead readers to ask "yea, so what?" so that we can move to the `Complication`

## What's a Complication
- It's the "What's next?" after the `Situation` that creates tension to raise the `Question`
- Not exactly a problem but more like the next challenge or obstacle that disrupts the resolve of `Situation`
- Example:
  - We have a task -> `Something stops us from doing it` -> What should we do?
  - We have a problem -> `We know the possible solution` -> How to implement it?
  - We have a problem -> `A solution has been suggested` -> Is it the right solution?
  - We took an action -> `It didn't work` -> Why not? What do we do next?
```
S: Among all executive decisions, few are more difficult than choosing between capital investment options. 
C: The challenge lies not in calculating returns, but in the assumptions—each uncertain on its own, and together creating critical risk. Current tools offer little help in evaluating this risk. 
A: A better approach is to measure risk realistically at each potential return level, enabling executives to compare alternatives more confidently against corporate goals.
```
  - In this example, the Situation is "Choosing between capital investment options is the most difficult thing to do"
  - `Complication`: No way to know the risk degree, current tools don't help either
  - Question: Is there a way to assess risks?
  - Answer: Yes
## Why that order?
- The order Situation - Complication - Question - Answer is important in the introduction
- But rearranging the order of those elements can set the tone for the document:
1. Standard S-C-Q-A: balanced and factual, present the context first and finally propose action
2. Direct A-S-C: Action oriented, start with the action to show decisiveness 
3. Concerned C-S-A: Cautious and critical, begin with the problem to convey urgency or dissatisfaction
4. Aggressive Q-S-C-A: Challenging and persuasive, open with a question to provoke attention and drive action

## Key Line
- Key line answers for the main question of the document 
- It outlines the plan or structures the document
- In long documents, list key lines points clearly at the start of the document with indents and centered, then use them as section headings. This helps the readers grasp the whole arguments within seconds and decide whether to keep reading
- In short documents, use key line points as topic sentences, which is the main sentence of a paragraph instead of repeating them as headings
- Each Key Line point should express an idea, not just a subject
- Avoid generic sections like "Background" or "Introduction", they don't convey the message or logical structure
- Listing out subjects without showing the connection between them weakens the arguments and confuses the readers

## How long a story?
- Should be long enough so that we and the readers are standing in the same place before taking to arguments
- Should be 2-3 paragraphs, ideally
- Situation and Complication can be each 3-4 paragraphs but never more than that

## Do I need to introduce the Key Line points?
- Yes, and it should follow the same S-C-Q pattern although much more brief
- Example:
  - S: TQM was a hot management tool in the 80s for companies to cut costs, improve quality and competitiveness
  - C: Many companies adopted it but few were successful
  - Q: How were these companies successful while the others weren't
  - The Key line: 
    - Leaders are adding Benchmarking to judge the comparativeness 
    - Activity-based Management to judge the real costs of services or products
    - Focus TQM techniques that will make a difference
- Use the heading that relfects the essense of the point, then introduce the point
- Do not do this:
```
BENCHMARKING
Leaders are using benchmarking to judge the comparativeness, effectiveness of their services. To do so, they ...
```
- Instead, do this:
```
BENCHMARKING PROCESS EFFICIENCY
Suppose you have to put TQM to cut costs at your company in half. You'd assume that such reduction in costs would give your company the competitiveness but does it really? You can't tell until you compare it with the competition

DETERMINING THE REAL COSTS
Let's say you have already reached the top and become the best. Everybody else use you as the standard to compare their services and products. You're entitled to be proud of what you have achieved. But ask yourself one question, is what you're best at really worth doing? And you can't know the answer until you use Activity-based Management to measure by activity rather than by function
```
- Introductions are meant to `remind` and `not inform`, so include only facts that readers would agree already
- Introductions always contain `3 elements` of a story: Situation, Complication and Solution
- The length of the introduction depends on the need to introduce the readers to relevant information of the problem: background, context, your involvement, early investigations, ...
- In a document, there is only `ONE question`, there can't be 2 or more because if the first question's answer is No, there won't be a second part, and if the first answer is Yes then it should be the main question itself, which in turns raises the question "How" (the second question)

# Some common patterns
- Some very common questions we encounter when writing a document
  - What should we do? (Giving direction)
  - How should we do it? (Explaining how)
  - Should we do it? (Seeking approval)
  - Why did it happen?

## Giving direction
- Generally, a giving direction structure is like this:
  - S: we want to do X
  - C: but we need to do Y to do X
  - Q: how do we do Y?
## Seeking approval
- A question that seeks approval:
  - S: We have a problem
  - C: We have a solution that costs $
  - Q: Should we approve it? 
- Example:
```
S: As you know, the work for our department has increased by 20% while we still keep the headcount of 14 people. As the result, overtime and weekend work has become common while our backlog is increased to 22 weeks.
C: The field has deemed that 22 weeks is not acceptable and we cannot extend work hour any futher. Research has found that we can boost our productivity and reduce backlog by installing an IBM at a cost of ...$
Q: (Should I approve it?)
A: We strongly recommend you approve this purchase
```
- We can also support this answer with reasons:
```
- Resolution of the problem cannot wait 
- This is the best solution we can find to resolve the problem
- The cost will be offset by the projected saving
- Other benefits of having an IBM
```
## Explaining how
- Whenever there is a "How" question, the answer always contains of "steps"
- Explaining how structure usually has 2 cases:
- Doing something new:
  - Must do X
  - Don't know how to do X
  - How to do it?
- Improving something existing:
  - Current system is X
  - X is not working properly
  - How to do it properly
- To build Key line points, compare the existing system vs the ideal system. The difference is the Key line on how to get there.
- We must lay out the current and the ideal process side by side before we write so that we don't miss any steps or think incorrectly.
- The processes can be laid out in diagram, list or flow outline

## Present the alternatives
- Alternatives to a solution don't actually exist if the problem has been properly analyzed, however some times we still get the demand to provide the alternatives
- The only time we have to write about alternatives is when the readers already know about them in advance.
```
S: As you know the recent ruling that 5-105HP motor is the most efficient for drilling has lead to our customers to switch our 10 HP motor for a 7 3/4 HP.
C: We have 3 possible responses:
  - Cut the price of our 10 HP to the 7 3/4 HP
  - Reengineer the 7 1/2 HP to function similar to a 7 3/4 HP
  - Design a new 5-105HP
Q: which one makes most sense?
```
- We have 2 ways to structure the Key line on how we select 1 alternative over the others
- Criteria: it's faster, it's cheaper, it's less risky... but other alternatives aren't always worse in all area, for that we need to present each pros and cons, and we can state the major reasons why we go with A and major reasons to drop B and C
- But in some situation, it doesn't give the major reasons to choose one over the others, and so we can give the conditional answers: if you want X, can go with A, but if you want Y, the better option is B

# Some common patterns - Consulting
- Different from regular writings, longer and to drive actions
- Focus on:
  - What is the problem?
  - Why does it matter?
  - What should we do about it?
- Less about facts and more about pursuading clients to take action
## Letter of Proposal
- Most important document of consulting, basically a sale pitch
- The basic structure is:
  - S: you have a problem
  - C: you have decided to bring outside help
  - Q: are we the right consultant for you
- The answer is always "Yes", followed by the supporting arguments:
  - We understand your problem
  - We have a solid approach to solve it
  - We have extensive experience implementing it
  - Our commercial terms make sense
- The tone depends on the type of client
  - For new client, it should focus on explaining the problem in details and demonstrating expertise
  - For existing client or a formal follow-up, the problem is summerized briefly and focus more on the solution
- Administrative details like pricing or contracts usually go into a covering letter
## Progress review
- Formal update delivered to clients at the end of a project
- First progress review structure:
  - We have been working on X
  - We said step 1 was to determine if Y is true, we've done that
  - What did we find?
- Later progress reviews structure:
  - Previously, we told you X
  - You told us to go investigate, we have completed that
  - What did we find?
  - Here is the result

# Deduction and induction differences
- A well-structured document is where:
  - Above ideas summerize its below ideas
  - Below ideas support the above ideas
  - Peer ideas are arranged in a logical order
- Logical orders follow 1 of the 2 reasoning patterns: Deductive and Inductive
- Deductive is a sequence of statements that lead to a conclusion, each point depends on the previous one
- Inductive is grouping of similar facts that leads to a generic statement, each point is independent but share common patterns between them
## Deductive reasoning
- Easy to think but hard to write
- It follows these steps:
  - Make a statement about a situation that exists in the world that is generally agreed
  - Make another statement about a related situation that also exists. It's related to the subject or predicate of the first statement
  - State the implication of these 2 existing in the world at the same time.
- Example:
  - Bird can fly
  - I'm a bird
  - Therefore I can fly
- Sometimes deductive reasoning can be tedious if it overexplain a straightforward problem
- On the `Key line` level, should avoid `deductive` and go with `inductive` instead because it's easier to remember all independent facts than ordered facts and their supporting arguments
- Inductive isn't more powerful than deductive, they are both reasoning
- At the late stage of an analysis when we have all the findings, conclusions and recommendations, we can have a Recommendation Worksheet.
- We can reach the conclusions from findings using 3 reasoning patterns: Deduction, Induction and Abduction (making hypothesis and testing)
- Once the analysis is complete, we can choose to present it either:
  - Deductively: for clients who care more about analysis
  - Inductively: for clients who care more about solutions
- Example of when to do it inductively:
  - Tell me how to cut costs?
  - It's easy
  - How?
  - Here is how:
    - Key line:
      - Cut this 
      - Buy that
      - Raise prices
- Example of when to do it deductively:
  - Tell me how to cut costs?
  - Forget about it, you should sell your business entirely
  - What? Why? 
  - Because:
    - Key line:
      - Your business is not making money and you keep borrowing
      - Thus you are drowning in debt and it's too late to repay
      - Therefore, selling is the best option
- Deductive is only used at high level when readers fail to comprehend but it rarely happens
- At high level, where sections in key line are separated, it's better to use Inductive
- Deductive should be used at lower level

## Inductive reasoning
- Inductive reasoning is hard because it requires creativity
- Observe several facts/events and find their patterns and draw a conclusion about what those patterns mean
### How it works
- Find 1 word that describes the grouping, it's always a plural noun
- Check your reasoning by asking question from bottom up
  - Example: If you see a man who found a Latin-spreaking city, dig deep in the earth to find new substances, can you refer that this man is an ingenious man but not a man of strong practical sense?
### How to differ Inductive from Deductive
- Very different, in deductive, the second point must comment on the predicate of the first
- If not then it's not Deductive
- Inductive is when points share similar predicate 
- If there are no similarities, no inferance can be drawn then the points do not belong to the same group

# Imposing logical order
- The 2nd rule of Minto is that ideas should be logically grouped together, this is because the mind already recognizes the logical relationship
- Time order: Causes and effect
  - Cause 1
  - Cause 2
  - Cause 3
  - => Effect
- Structural order: divide a whole into parts
  - Company 1
  - Division A
  - Division B
  - Division C
- Degree order: Classify like things
  - Universal problems
  - These 3 problems
  - All other problems
## Time order
- Easiest to do because it follows the order of what to do first
- Clarity could suffer if we can't distinguish between cause and effect
- Large lists make it harder to follow
  - Example: The following steps need to be taken in Phase 1:
    1. Intervievv key management and supervisory personnel
    2. Trace and document transactions and work flow
    ...
    8. Identify and justify potential opportunity areas for productivity improvement
- Instead we can abstract these steps with higher steps
  - Example:
    1. Determine the critical functions
    2. Identify weeknesses
    3. Recommend practical ways
- A quick way to avoid cause-effect mistake is to visualize yourself following these steps to see if they make sense
- Recognizing your points are made from an underlying process helps clarify your message
- Example: Business defi
  - Relies on creative processes
  - Changes over time
  - Not necessarily unique
  - Influenced by competitive strength
- All of these belong to the same group and each one makes sense on their own, but they're mix of observation without any logic behind
- Example: 
  - Identify market segments
  - Assess competitive position
  - Track how your position change over time
## Structural order
- When divide a structure into smaller parts, make sure that these parts:
  - Mutually exclusive
  - Collectively exhaustive
- Example:
  - Akron tire and rubber company
    - Tire division
    - Housewares Division
    - Sports equipment division
- Mutually exclusive means that whatever in Tire division is not in Housewares division, aka no overlaps
- Collectively exhaustive means the combination of all 3 divisions covers everything in Akron company
- There are 3 ways to divide an organization
  1. By the activities
  2. By locations
  3. By products and market segments
- When already have a structure, we can start analyzing it, from top to bottom or from left to right
- We can use concept of structural order to sort out faulty logic in groupings
- Example: an executive argument on why a drink company should not produce its own plastic bottles
  - Technical risks - design problem
  - Environmental risks - ban on nonreturnable bottles
  - Premium risks - consumer rejection of premium packges during an inflatory period
  - Capital intensiveness
  - Negative Earning per Share
  - Near term R&D
  - Cashflow problem
  ...
- These can be abstracted with a higher grouping:
  - Regulatory
  - Low earning per share
  - Low Return of investment
- So it can be rewritten like so:
  - We should think carefully about going into plastic bottle business. If there is a ban on nonreturnable bottles, we maybe preluded from doing so.
  - Even if there is no ban, it will still dilute our profitability
    - In short term: Low ROI
    - In long term: Low EPS
  - And then use other ideas to support these arguments
## Degree order
- Order of importance
- To clarify a message, we usually have to check if a group is a result of an underlying process or a class grouping
- Example: a analysis shows how traditional financial focus often leads to misleading prescription:
  - Invest whenever expected returns exceed capital
  - Better quantification of risks
  - Planning and budget are 2 different process
  - Leadership questions numbers instead of underlying thinkings
- To restate this
  - Encourage investment based only on return
  - Emphasize on risk quantificatino
  - Separate planning and budgeting
  - Shift mangement focus to numbers
- So this order suggests that the ideas come from `a process`
- To rewrite this now as we know it's from `a process`
  ```
  The traditional financial approach to investment evaluation often leads to poor resource allocation because it:
  - Overemphasizes on uncertanty and risks
  - Draws management focus to numbers instead of reasoning
  - Promotes investing whenever expected returns exceed capital while ignoring other factors
  ```
- Example: Complains:
  1. Report frequency is inappropriate
  2. Inventory data are too late
  3. Inventory data are unreliable
  4. Inventory data cannot be matched to sales data
  5. They want elimination of meaningless data
  6. They want better report formats
  7. They want exception highlighting
  8. They want to do fewer calculations manually
- If we group these problems, we could have 3 groups:
  1. Bad timing
  2. Poor data collection
  3. Poor report writing
- The question is how to order this group, that depends on the process of how to fix this problem, and the process depends on the question being asked
  - Why do they hate the data: 1, 3, 2
  - Why do systems produce useless data: 2, 3, 1
  - How to improve reporting: 3, 2, 1

# Summarizing Grouped Ideas
- Ideas at each level summarize the ideas below them
- Most writers fail because they use interlectually blank, like "3 objects", "2 problems", which only state what's coming rather than summarize

## Avoid interlectually blank insertions
- Interlectual blanks give no ideas, confuse readers and could make them misunderstand
- Example: John Wain should write Johnson's biography because of 3 reasons: ...
- The readers expect the first reason to be the main point and ignore the rest
- Instead the writer should start with: John Wain should write Johnson's biography because they're similar kinds of people. Then the listeners would understand the main point instead of talking over each other.
- To create proper grouping summaries, they have to be derived from MECE groupings
- The summaries can fall into 2 types:
  - Action statement: tells readers to do something
  - Situation statement: descibres something
- In other word, in Inductive groups, the statements need to suggest either:
  - The result of the actions
  - The insight from other similar situations
## State the effect of actions
- Summarizing actions is hard
- Summary of actions if always the result of those actions
- Actions in the same groups don't always relate to each other but they jointly create the same effect
- Actions look the same, always "we should do..", "we will...", so it's hard to see how they fit together without looking at the effect they create, but then this creates a loop:
  - Can't judge if the list is complete without looking into the effect
  - The effect depends on the list of actions being complete
- There are 3 techniques can help
  - State each action as specifically as possible before relating them
  - Find small cause-effect clusters so each group has no more than 5 steps
  - Derive the effect directly from the actions 
### Wording specifically
- To build cause-effect hierarchy, each action group must be MECE
- The effect above it has to be very specifically stated, "improve profit" or "make better" are not specific.
- Instead, we need to be specific about the end product, for example "improve profit by 10% by Jan 15"
- Even if we don't have the numbers, another trick is to imagine what the readers would have at the end of the action
- Vague step by step actions make it impossible to understand what to do:
- Example:
  - Strengthen regional effectiveness -> Assign planning repsonsibility to the regions
  - Reduce account receivable -> Establish a system for following up overdue accounts
  - Review management process -> Determine if the management needs to be revised
  - ...
