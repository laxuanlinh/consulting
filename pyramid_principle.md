# Why pyramid structure
- People automatically sort and categorize information in a pyramidal group so it's easier for them if we can presort it.
- Any documents written should be deliberately structured as a pyramid
- The magical number of Seven (+-2), when the number of ideas/items is more than 7, the mind starts to organize them into categories, so that we remember the abstract levels instead of the items themselves
- Example:
  - Apple
  - Milk
  - Orange
  - Grapes
  - Eggs
  - Potatoes
  - Carrots
  - Butter
  - Sour cream
- These can be categorized into 3 categories:
  - Fruits
  - Dairy food
  - Vegetables
# Thinking from botom up
- The thinking that leads to the top down structure is actually opposite, it's bottom up
- After grouping ideas to support 1 level of abstraction up, we can build the pyramid until there is no idea left
- The ideas in a pyramid must always summerize the ideas below them
- The ideas in the same group have to be the same kind of idea. For example: apple and orange are both fruit, but apple and chair are not the same kind.
- The ideas in the same group have to be logically ordered
  - If it's formed by reasoning deductively then we order by argument order (big premise, minor premise, conclusion)
  - If it's formed by working out cause-and-effect then we order chronologically
  - If it's by commenting on an existing structure then we go with structure 
  - And if it's by categorizing then we go with the importance 

**Main Message / Recommendation**
- **Key Line (summary of logic)**
  - Argument A  
    - Evidence A1  
    - Evidence A2  
  - Argument B  
    - Evidence B1  
  - Argument C  
    - Evidence C1  
    - Evidence C2


# Substructures within the pyramid
- When start writing, we can't form the clear structure yet but there are relationships we can rely on to speed up this process
## The Vertical relationship
- Helps set up a question/answer dialogue which will keep the listener interested because it forces them to respond logically
- Each box contains an idea, it raises a question in listener's mind because we're telling them something they don't know.
- And when we tell someone something they don't know, it automatically raises a question in their mind, how? Why?
- We continue to raise and answer questions, until we reach the point when the listener no longer has any questions, then we can leave the first leg and go back to the Key Line to keep answering other arguments
- To ensure total reader attention, we need to refrain from raising any questions that you don't have the clear answer or from answering questions before raising them.
- Example
  - ❌: We assumne that the customers prefer digital banks over traditional bank, that cost reduction is key and migration to cloud is feasible. Therefore, we recommend to replace the core in 24 months and develop a new digital banking app
  - ✅: We recommend replacing the core in 24 months and develop a new digital banking app because it could reduce cost in long term, improves compliance, enable new products and capture customers interest. This conclusion rests in 3 assumption:
    - Customers prefer digital bank over traditional
    - Legacy core maintenance costs exceed 10% of our budget
    - Cloud migration is feasible
- In the first example, we're answering the question before raising them. The question here `ISN'T` the question `in the text` but the question in `reader's mind`. By stating the answer in the second text, we raise the question "How" in `reader's mind` and continue to elaborate
- Another example:
**Pigs should be kept as pet** (why?)
  **Key Line (summary of logic)**
    **They are beautiful** (how are they beautiful?)
        ***They're maverlously fat*** (how is fat beautiful?)
        - Present lovely curves to the outlooker 
        - Create modesty in the professor
        ***They're typically English*** (how is English beautiful?)
        1. Linked to the land (how are they linked to the land?)
           - Like the chalk downs
           - Like the beech tree
        2. Symbolize that power is not inconsistent with kindness
        3. So English, they deserve to be national symbol
    **Could be bred to fascinating variations** (How? And why?)
        ***In types***
        ***In size***
        ***In personalities***
        ***In functions***

## The horizontal relationship
- This is the relationship between sibling ideas, at the same level that support another idea 1 level above.
- The statement we say below not only has to answer the question above it but also answer it logically, either inductively or deductively but never both.
### Deductive grouping
- Deductive grouping presents an argument in successive steps:
  - First idea: states a general truth
  - Second idea: relates to a specific case, of our own
  - Third idea: draws a conclusion from both
- Example:
  - Exercise improves health (a general truth)
  - Walking is a form of exercise (a more specific form of exercise)
  - Therefore, walking improve health (conclusion)
- In the case of core banking system:
  - Legacy core systems are costly to maintain, and our core is not an exception.
  - This states a general truth that legacy cores are costly, and because our core is legacy (omitted), it's obviously expensive too.
### Inductive thinking
- Group a list of independent ideas to support the bigger idea
- Example:
  - The core banking system is 15 years old
  - Its end of day operations cost a downtime of 2 hours
  - It's unstable and results in customers' complaints
  - Thus we need to replace it with a newer next generation core
## The introductory flow
- The narrative should start by answering the question that is already in the reader's mind or it would exist if the reader thinks about it.
- To make the question surface naturally, follow the pattern:
  - Situation: the current state
  - Complication: what has gone wrong/not working
  - Question: show the problem that arises from the complication
  - Answer: present the main point
- This offers a few advantages:
  - You and the reader start from the same understanding of reality
  - The reader wants to know the answer before you answering it
  - Clear focus and logical flow
- Example:
  - ❌: The purpose of this document is to pull together some ideas to address some problems of the current core banking system such as:
    1. It's a legacy system that has served for 15 years
    2. Its costs exceed IT budget by 10%
    3. It usually results in downtimes that draws customers' complaints
    4. Compliance issues with regulators
  - ✅: The bank’s current core system has operated for 15 years without modernization. It now exceeds the IT budget by 10%, experiences frequent downtime, and struggles to meet new regulatory requirements — all of which affect customer satisfaction. To address these issues, we recommend replacing it with a modern, cloud-native core that delivers high availability, lower maintenance cost, and full compliance with current standards.
- In the first example, we already answer a` question that has not been raised`: let's address the problem. What is the problem? Why are we addressing it already?
- In the second example, we state the `problem` that everyone knows about (legacy core), then its `complication` (downtime, compliance...) which `raises a question` in reader's mind (ok how to address this) if they have not thought about it already, then we answer the question.
- If the reader has `already had the question` (how to address these problems) then it seems `redundant` at first, but if the reader has not thought about question, then the first few sentences should `help raise it`.

# How to build a pyramid structure
## Top-down approach
1. Draw a box on top of the pyramid, write the subject we're discussing about
2. Decide the question: visualize the reader, to whom we're dicussing with, and what question do we want to answer in his mind? State that question
3. Write down the answer if we know it
4. Identify the situation: state a fact that the reader could agree with. This is to share the same reality with the reader before raising the question. This fact becomes the `Situation`
5. Develop the `Complication`: begin the question/answer dialogue with the reader. Imagine that they nod and say "Yes I know that, so what?". This helps us raise the question in reader's mind from the `Situation`: something went wrong, disrepancies?
6. Recheck the Question and Answer: the statement of `Complication` should raise the same `question` that we decided in the step 2, if not then perhaps the `question` was wrong or our `Complication` was wrong, we have to change the `Complication` or think again
- This entire process is to make sure we know the Question we want to answer, once we have the question, everything else falls into place
- Example:
  - ❌: We have received the request to review the feasibility of processing Big Chief's Delivery ticket via disk in to our National Accounts System. We have completed our review and here is our findings:
    - Big Chief needs to follow this format...
    - Big Chief will create a program that run against their new file to extract all tickets. The output file will be in a format accepted by our NA system.
    - Upon completion, the balanced cash disk will be processed through our NA system...
- This example doesn't answer the main question: "Is it feasible?" but goes straight to "How to do it?"
- If we follow the Top-down approach, here are the steps:
    1. What is the subject: Big Chief is asking for a change
    2. What is the question: is it feasible to process the disk?
    3. What is the answer: Yes
    4. What is the situation: Big Chief asks us to process a disk instead of thousand of tickets `(move the subject to the situation, this is a fact, easy to agree with)`
    5. What is the complication: They're asking is it possible (`make sure that this statement is aligned with the question from step 2`)
    6. Move to the next question: but why would we do that?
    7. Answer to the next question with arguments: better cash flow, less work load, gives us the information we need
## Bottom-up approach
1. List out all points we want to make
2. Try to find relationships between them
3. Draw conclusion
- Example: findings at the printing company about their process that point out that they're inefficient and not competitive
  - Problems:
    - Low productivity in composing
    - Same steps for each job
    - Uncompetitive for simple jobs
    - Behind schedule
    - Lower wages
    - Shortage of people
    - High overtime
    - Below PAR
  - Solutions:
    - Simplify the process for cheap jobs
    - Increase productivity by changing methods
- Find the relationship, looks like there is some cause-and-effect relationships here:
  - Lower wages
  -> Shortage of people
  -> Behind schedule
  -> High overtime
  -> High cost
  - Same steps
  -> Below PAR 
  -> Low productivity
  => everything leads to Uncompetitive price
- Since we have all the ideas/findings and relationships, we can start to fit them into the model:
  - Situation (what are the known facts): composition costs are the most important and Uncompetitive
  - Questions: how to reduce composition costs and increase productivity
  - Complications: 
    - Shortage of good compositors, lower wages, high overtime, lower than PAR => can we hire better people, and retain our people? Yes
    - Same steps for all process, increases price, lower than PAR => can we make this more efficient? Yes
  - Key line (How do we solve this)
    - Raise the wages to hire more people and retain the compositors we have
    - Cut unnecessary steps to increase efficiency and reduce price.
- Higher wages:
  `why?`- Can hire more people
    `why?`- Get more work done efficiently
      `how?`- More experienced compositors
      `how?`- Bigger workforce to share the work
    `why?`- Retain people
      `how?`- Less work per compositor
      `how?`- No more overtime
  `why?`- Help retain people
    `how?`- People like to stay because the income is higher

- Cut unncessary steps:
  `why?`- Can reduce the amount of work
    `how?`- All redundant steps are eliminated which reduces worker's time
  `why?`- Can reduce prices for simple jobs
    `how?`- With less time spending on these steps, we can reduce unncessary costs

- Rewrite the findings:
```
After two weeks of analysis, I found that composition costs — currently accounting for 40–55% of total printing expenses — can be reduced by around 10% while improving our productivity and pricing competitiveness.
We recommend two initiatives to achieve this:
- Raise the wages of compositors to attract and retain skilled workers.
- Eliminate redundant steps in the composition process to streamline production.

1. Raise the wages of compositors
Our current wages are lower than the market average, making it difficult to hire and retain experienced compositors. This shortage has led to undercapacity, excessive overtime, and, recently, the resignation of two staff members.
By raising wages to a competitive level, we can:
- Expand the workforce: Attract skilled compositors who work more efficiently, share the workload, and improve overall quality.
- Retain existing staff: Reduce overtime and stress, leading to higher satisfaction and lower turnover.
A stable, experienced team will improve both productivity and quality, helping us meet or exceed our PAR targets.

1. Eliminate redundant steps in composition
Our current process includes repeated checks designed to ensure quality. While effective, these repetitions add unnecessary time and cost, especially for simple jobs.
By removing redundant steps where quality will not be compromised, we can:
- Increase productivity: Reduce the time required per job and improve overall throughput.
- Lower costs for simple jobs: Make our pricing more competitive in high-volume, low-margin work.
A review team is already comparing the current process with a simplified one to measure the marginal difference. Early findings indicate that these changes could reduce composition costs by approximately 10% without affecting quality.

In summary, raising wages and simplifying workflows will help us solve the capacity issue, improve productivity, and strengthen our price competitiveness.

# For beginners
1. Always try with `top-down` first 
2. Use the `Situation` as the starting point for thinking throught the introduction
3. Don't omit thinking through the introduction, if you know the `Question` of the `Situation`, then `ask it out loud` before moving to the `Key line` and answering the new `questions`
4. Always put `historical chronology` in the introduction, mention the time and place the situation happens because in the body, there are only logical ideas 
5. `Limit` the introduction to what the readers will `agree` is true
6. If possible, use `induction` over `deduction` to formulate arguments on the Key line level because it's less effort to comprehend, you state the conclusion and then begin to introduce supporting facts/arguments

## Where to start the Situation
- If it's a memo, start with something that both you and reader already agree with
- If it's report or publication, start with a generally accepted fact
- The opening should be:
  - Grounded in a specific `time` and `place`
  - Facts that readers natually accept
  - Lead readers to ask "yea, so what?" so that we can move to the `Complication`

## What's a Complication
- It's the "What's next?" after the `Situation` that creates tension to raise the `Question`
- Not exactly a problem but more like the next challenge or obstacle that disrupts the resolve of `Situation`
- Example:
  - We have a task -> `Something stops us from doing it` -> What should we do?
  - We have a problem -> `We know the possible solution` -> How to implement it?
  - We have a problem -> `A solution has been suggested` -> Is it the right solution?
  - We took an action -> `It didn't work` -> Why not? What do we do next?
```
S: Among all executive decisions, few are more difficult than choosing between capital investment options. 
C: The challenge lies not in calculating returns, but in the assumptions—each uncertain on its own, and together creating critical risk. Current tools offer little help in evaluating this risk. 
A: A better approach is to measure risk realistically at each potential return level, enabling executives to compare alternatives more confidently against corporate goals.
```
  - In this example, the Situation is "Choosing between capital investment options is the most difficult thing to do"
  - `Complication`: No way to know the risk degree, current tools don't help either
  - Question: Is there a way to assess risks?
  - Answer: Yes
## Why that order?
- The order Situation - Complication - Question - Answer is important in the introduction
- But rearranging the order of those elements can set the tone for the document:
1. Standard S-C-Q-A: balanced and factual, present the context first and finally propose action
2. Direct A-S-C: Action oriented, start with the action to show decisiveness 
3. Concerned C-S-A: Cautious and critical, begin with the problem to convey urgency or dissatisfaction
4. Aggressive Q-S-C-A: Challenging and persuasive, open with a question to provoke attention and drive action

## Key Line
- Key line answers for the main question of the document 
- It outlines the plan or structures the document
- In long documents, list key lines points clearly at the start of the document with indents and centered, then use them as section headings. This helps the readers grasp the whole arguments within seconds and decide whether to keep reading
- In short documents, use key line points as topic sentences, which is the main sentence of a paragraph instead of repeating them as headings
- Each Key Line point should express an idea, not just a subject
- Avoid generic sections like "Background" or "Introduction", they don't convey the message or logical structure
- Listing out subjects without showing the connection between them weakens the arguments and confuses the readers

## How long a story?
- Should be long enough so that we and the readers are standing in the same place before taking to arguments
- Should be 2-3 paragraphs, ideally
- Situation and Complication can be each 3-4 paragraphs but never more than that

## Do I need to introduce the Key Line points?
- Yes, and it should follow the same S-C-Q pattern although much more brief
- Example:
  - S: TQM was a hot management tool in the 80s for companies to cut costs, improve quality and competitiveness
  - C: Many companies adopted it but few were successful
  - Q: How were these companies successful while the others weren't
  - The Key line: 
    - Leaders are adding Benchmarking to judge the comparativeness 
    - Activity-based Management to judge the real costs of services or products
    - Focus TQM techniques that will make a difference
- Use the heading that relfects the essense of the point, then introduce the point
- Do not do this:
```
BENCHMARKING
Leaders are using benchmarking to judge the comparativeness, effectiveness of their services. To do so, they ...
```
- Instead, do this:
```
BENCHMARKING PROCESS EFFICIENCY
Suppose you have to put TQM to cut costs at your company in half. You'd assume that such reduction in costs would give your company the competitiveness but does it really? You can't tell until you compare it with the competition

DETERMINING THE REAL COSTS
Let's say you have already reached the top and become the best. Everybody else use you as the standard to compare their services and products. You're entitled to be proud of what you have achieved. But ask yourself one question, is what you're best at really worth doing? And you can't know the answer until you use Activity-based Management to measure by activity rather than by function
```
- Introductions are meant to `remind` and `not inform`, so include only facts that readers would agree already
- Introductions always contain `3 elements` of a story: Situation, Complication and Solution
- The length of the introduction depends on the need to introduce the readers to relevant information of the problem: background, context, your involvement, early investigations, ...
- In a document, there is only `ONE question`, there can't be 2 or more because if the first question's answer is No, there won't be a second part, and if the first answer is Yes then it should be the main question itself, which in turns raises the question "How" (the second question)
-
