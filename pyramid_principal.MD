# Why pyramid structure
- People automatically sort and categorize information in a pyramidal group so it's easier for them if we can presort it.
- Any documents written should be deliberately structured as a pyramid
- The magical number of Seven (+-2), when the number of ideas/items is more than 7, the mind starts to organize them into categories, so that we remember the abstract levels instead of the items themselves
- Example:
  - Apple
  - Milk
  - Orange
  - Grapes
  - Eggs
  - Potatoes
  - Carrots
  - Butter
  - Sour cream
- These can be categorized into 3 categories:
  - Fruits
  - Dairy food
  - Vegetables
# Thinking from botom up
- The thinking that leads to the top down structure is actually opposite, it's bottom up
- After grouping ideas to support 1 level of abstraction up, we can build the pyramid until there is no idea left
- The ideas in a pyramid must always summerize the ideas below them
- The ideas in the same group have to be the same kind of idea. For example: apple and orange are both fruit, but apple and chair are not the same kind.
- The ideas in the same group have to be logically ordered
  - If it's formed by reasoning deductively then we order by argument order (big premise, minor premise, conclusion)
  - If it's formed by working out cause-and-effect then we order chronologically
  - If it's by commenting on an existing structure then we go with structure 
  - And if it's by categorizing then we go with the importance 

üî∑ **Main Message / Recommendation**

# Substructures within the pyramid
- When start writing, we can't form the clear structure yet but there are relationships we can rely on to speed up this process
## The Vertical relationship
- Helps set up a question/answer dialogue which will keep the listener interested because it forces them to respond logically
- Each box contains an idea, it raises a question in listener's mind because we're telling them something they don't know.
- And when we tell someone something they don't know, it automatically raises a question in their mind, how? Why?
- We continue to raise and answer questions, until we reach the point when the listener no longer has any questions, then we can leave the first leg and go back to the Key Line to keep answering other arguments
- To ensure total reader attention, we need to refrain from raising any questions that you don't have the clear answer or from answering questions before raising them.
- Example
    ‚ùå: We assumne that the customers prefer digital banks over traditional bank, that cost reduction is key and migration to cloud is feasible. Therefore, we recommend to replace the core in 24 months and develop a new digital banking app
    ‚úÖ: We recommend replacing the core in 24 months and develop a new digital banking app because it could reduce cost in long term, improves compliance, enable new products and capture customers interest. This conclusion rests in 3 assumption:
    - Customers prefer digital bank over traditional
    - Legacy core maintenance costs exceed 10% of our budget
    - Cloud migration is feasible
- In the first example, we're answering the question before raising them. The question here `ISN'T` the question `in the text` but the question in `reader's mind`. By stating the answer in the second text, we raise the question "How" in `reader's mind` and continue to elaborate
- Another example:
**Pigs should be kept as pet** (why?)
  **Key Line (summary of logic)**
    **They are beautiful** (how are they beautiful?)
        ***They're maverlously fat*** (how is fat beautiful?)
        - Present lovely curves to the outlooker 
        - Create modesty in the professor
        ***They're typically English*** (how is English beautiful?)
        1. Linked to the land (how are they linked to the land?)
           - Like the chalk downs
           - Like the beech tree
        2. Symbolize that power is not inconsistent with kindness
        3. So English, they deserve to be national symbol
    **Could be bred to fascinating variations** (How? And why?)
        ***In types***
        ***In size***
        ***In personalities***
        ***In functions***

## The horizontal relationship
- This is the relationship between sibling ideas, at the same level that support another idea 1 level above.
- The statement we say below not only has to answer the question above it but also answer it logically, either inductively or deductively but never both.
### Deductive grouping
- Deductive grouping presents an argument in successive steps:
  - First idea: states a general truth
  - Second idea: relates to a specific case, of our own
  - Third idea: draws a conclusion from both
- Example:
  - Exercise improves health (a general truth)
  - Walking is a form of exercise (a more specific form of exercise)
  - Therefore, walking improve health (conclusion)
- In the case of core banking system:
  - Legacy core systems are costly to maintain, and our core is not an exception.
  - This states a general truth that legacy cores are costly, and because our core is legacy (omitted), it's obviously expensive too.
### Inductive thinking
- Group a list of independent ideas to support the bigger idea
- Example:
  - The core banking system is 15 years old
  - Its end of day operations cost a downtime of 2 hours
  - It's unstable and results in customers' complaints
  - Thus we need to replace it with a newer next generation core
## The introductory flow
- The narrative should start by answering the question that is already in the reader's mind or it would exist if the reader thinks about it.
- To make the question surface naturally, follow the pattern:
  - Situation: the current state
  - Complication: what has gone wrong/not working
  - Question: show the problem that arises from the complication
  - Answer: present the main point
- This offers a few advantages:
  - You and the reader start from the same understanding of reality
  - The reader wants to know the answer before you answering it
  - Clear focus and logical flow
- Example:
  ‚ùå: The purpose of this document is to pull together some ideas to address some problems of the current core banking system such as:
  1. It's a legacy system that has served for 15 years
  2. Its costs exceed IT budget by 10%
  3. It usually results in downtimes that draws customers' complaints
  4. Compliance issues with regulators
  ‚úÖ: The bank‚Äôs current core system has operated for 15 years without modernization. It now exceeds the IT budget by 10%, experiences frequent downtime, and struggles to meet new regulatory requirements ‚Äî all of which affect customer satisfaction. To address these issues, we recommend replacing it with a modern, cloud-native core that delivers high availability, lower maintenance cost, and full compliance with current standards.
- In the first example, we already answer a` question that has not been raised`: let's address the problem. What is the problem? Why are we addressing it already?
- In the second example, we state the `problem` that everyone knows about (legacy core), then its `complication` (downtime, compliance...) which `raises a question` in reader's mind (ok how to address this) if they have not thought about it already, then we answer the question.
- If the reader has `already had the question` (how to address these problems) then it seems `redundant` at first, but if the reader has not thought about question, then the first few sentences should `help raise it`.

# How to build a pyramid structure
## Top-down approach
1. Draw a box on top of the pyramid, write the subject we're discussing about
2. Decide the question: visualize the reader, to whom we're dicussing with, and what question do we want to answer in his mind? State that question
3. Write down the answer if we know it
4. Identify the situation: state a fact that the reader could agree with. This is to share the same reality with the reader before raising the question. This fact becomes the `Situation`
5. Develop the `Complication`: begin the question/answer dialogue with the reader. Imagine that they nod and say "Yes I know that, so what?". This helps us raise the question in reader's mind from the `Situation`: something went wrong, disrepancies?
6. Recheck the Question and Answer: the statement of `Complication` should raise the same `question` that we decided in the step 2, if not then perhaps the `question` was wrong or our `Complication` was wrong, we have to change the `Complication` or think again
- This entire process is to make sure we know the Question we want to answer, once we have the question, everything else falls into place
- Example:
  ‚ùå: We have received the request to review the feasibility of processing Big Chief's Delivery ticket via disk in to our National Accounts System. We have completed our review and here is our findings:
    - Big Chief needs to follow this format...
    - Big Chief will create a program that run against their new file to extract all tickets. The output file will be in a format accepted by our NA system.
    - Upon completion, the balanced cash disk will be processed through our NA system...
- This example doesn't answer the main question: "Is it feasible?" but goes straight to "How to do it?"
- If we follow the Top-down approach, here are the steps:
    1. What is the subject: Big Chief is asking for a change
    2. What is the question: is it feasible to process the disk?
    3. What is the answer: Yes
    4. What is the situation: Big Chief asks us to process a disk instead of thousand of tickets `(move the subject to the situation, this is a fact, easy to agree with)`
    5. What is the complication: They're asking is it possible (`make sure that this statement is aligned with the question from step 2`)
    6. Move to the next question: but why would we do that?
    7. Answer to the next question: better cash flow, less work load, gives us the information we need
    8.
